        <h3> Our Vision: </h3>
        To help improve the overall understanding of how cryptography is deployed, implemented, maintained and configured in different environments. 
        </p>

        <p id="values">
        <h3>Our Values: </h3>
        <strong>1. Security: </strong> <br />
        Security is only as strong as your weakest link. Security is complicated and of paramount importance for any organization and there are very little room for errors. Security needs to be a part of everyone's responsibility. Now more than ever, earning customer's satisfaction translates to un-complicated and foolproof security.  <br /> <br />

        <strong>2. Cryptography Has its weaknesses too: </strong> <br />
        Like anything else in this world, cryptography is not perfect. There are multiple reasons why this is the case. But there are still various flavours of cryptographic algorithms that are proven to be secure against a wide range of attacks. Through this knowledge base, we aim to ensure that any professional who wants to implement cryptography is up-to-date and is aware of which flavors to avoid, which configuration to setup, how to move to stronger cryptography etc.  <br /> <br />

        <strong>3. Change is the only constant: </strong><br />
        Security is adaptive and is based on context. Different organizational values lead to different security measures. Cryptography in particluar is an ever-changing landscape. Security (including cryptography) can never be achieved by a one-time setup. Like a well oiled machines, it needs to be maintained and tweaked from time to time. <br /> <br />  

        <h4>Methods:</h4> <br />
        <strong>1. Demystifying Cryptography:</strong> <br />
        Cryptography is a complicated subject. What makes it complicated are the plethora of options (in terms of configuration and deploying) that exist to achieve security. Everday use of cryptography for the majority of professionals does not necissitate understanding the intricate details of the various flavors available. Through cryptodoneright, we aim to deliver content to our audience in the a clear and coherent fashion. <br /> <br />

        <strong>2. Organized, easy-to-navigate Content:</strong> <br />
        One way to further complicate cryprography is poor, unorganized documentation. cryptodoneright aims to set a standard template around which content will be published. After a few click around, you should find the website very easy to navigate through and search.  <br /> <br />

        <strong>3. Community Driven: </strong> <br />
        The website will be using a centralized databased where anyone can come in and contribute content. The content will automatically render according to the standard templates to maintain the overall feel of the website consistent. <br />
        </p>

        <p id="Mission">
        <h3>Our Mission: </h3>
        Ultimately, we are looking to move towards to create a comprehensive database that aims to educate the working population to the complexities and intricacies of "Security" in a simple and easy manner.

        <h3>FAQ: </h3>
        <strong>3.1. What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? </strong> <br /> <br />

          The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A
          by a D, every B by a E, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone who knew the ``shift by 3'' rule could decipher his messages. <br /> <br />

          A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is
          the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
          you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis. <br /> <br />

          The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert
          plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext. <br /> <br />

          A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,
          Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here. <br /> <br />

          The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,
          eavesdroppers, or third parties. <br /> <br />

        <strong>3.2. What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? </strong><br /> <br />

          The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with the supposed secrecy of the algorithm. <br /> <br />

          A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above. It has a reasonably large unicity distance; see question 8.8. <br /> <br />

          A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]). <br /> <br />
            
          A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect. <br /> <br />

          If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.
          However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then
          he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring integers.'' See part 6. Failing that, it's a crap shoot. <br /> <br />

        <strong>3.3. If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? </strong><br /> <br />

          Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn't have a chance. <br /> <br />

          Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad, for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even
          chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See
          [KAH67]. <br /> <br />
          
        <strong>3.4. Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break? </strong><br /> <br />

          Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system. <br /> <br />

        <strong>3.5. What are the basic types of cryptanalytic `attacks'? </strong><br /> <br />

          A standard cryptanalytic attack is to know some plaintext matching a given piece of ciphertext and try to determine the key which maps one 
          to the other.  This plaintext can be known because it is standard (a standard greeting, a known header or trailer, ...) or because it is
          guessed.  If text is guessed to be in a message, its position is probably not known, but a message is usually short enough that the cryptanalyst
          can assume the known plaintext is in each possible position and do attacks for each case in parallel.  In this case, the known plaintext can
          be something so common that it is almost guaranteed to be in a message. <br /> <br />

          A strong encryption algorithm will be unbreakable not only under known plaintext (assuming the enemy knows all the plaintext for a given
          ciphertext) but also under "adaptive chosen plaintext" -- an attack making life much easier for the cryptanalyst.  In this attack, the enemy
          gets to choose what plaintext to use and gets to do this over and over, choosing the plaintext for round N+1 only after analyzing the result of
          round N. <br /> <br />

          For example, as far as we know, DES is reasonably strong even under an adaptive chosen plaintext attack (the attack Biham and Shamir used).  Of
          course, we do not have access to the secrets of government cryptanalytic services.  Still, it is the working assumption that DES is reasonably
          strong under known plaintext and triple-DES is very strong under all attacks.
