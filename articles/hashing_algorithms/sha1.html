               SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function
               designed by the United States National Security Agency and is a
               U.S. <a href="http://ciscodemo.isi.jhu.edu/template3.html#" title="Read More about Federal Information Processing Standards">
               Federal Information Processing Standard</a> published by the
               United States <acronym title="National Institute of Standards and Technology"> NIST</acronym>. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest. A SHA-1 hash value is typically
               rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.
             </p>
             
             
             <p>
               <strong>Cryptographic Hash Functions<br /></strong>
               The ideal hash function has three main properties:
               <ol>
                 <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> hash(X) always yield same result.</li>
                 <li><strong>One-Way:</strong> Given Y, hard to find X such that hash(X) = Y</li>
                 <li><strong>Collision Resistant:</strong> It is extremely unlikely that two slightly different messages will have the same hash.</li>
               </ol>
             </p>
             
             <p>
               <strong>What is a collision?<br /></strong>
               A collision or clash occurs when two different inputs to a function, typically one used to compress large data items into a smaller or fixed size, produce the same output, called (depending on the application) a hash value, checksum, fingerprint, or digest.
             </p>
             <p>
               Recently, SHA-1 was “SHAttered” or broken and an attack was developed wherein it is now pratically possible to craft two colliding PDF files and obtain a SHA-1 digital signature on the first PDF file which can also be abused as a valid signature on the second PDF file. Even though SHA-1 is broken, Do NOT Panic.
             </p>
             <p>
               Here is an example: By crafting the two colliding PDF files as two rental agreements with different rent, it is possible to trick someone to create a valid signature for a high-rent contract by having him or her sign a low-rent contract.

                <li>Identify assets that are most critical and focus on moving those out to something more stronger and reliable.</li>
                <li>Start by phasing out infrastructure where hashing is done for integrity check or digital signature.  </li>

              <p>
                <strong>Do not panic!<br /></strong>
                  Fun Fact!<br />
                  The SHAttered attack required over 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 SHA1 computations. This took the equivalent processing power as 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations.
                <p>
                  The attackers must be an extremely well-funded. The attack is not within the reach of anyone, but is within the reach of major organizations and nation-states.
                  Given the computational expense of carrying out such a collision, it is obvious that executing such an attack is sensible for only someone who has vested a great amount of interest and also has the computational powers (monetary) required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, the SHAttered attack is 100,000 faster than the brute force attack that relies on the birthday paradox. The brute force attack would require 12,000,000 GPU years to complete, and it is therefore impractical.

                The “SHAttered” attack technique doesn't allow an attacker to generate a collision with an existing file. For example, it's not possible to use this method to generate a malicious executable file which matches the signature of an existing legitimate executable. However, it would be possible for an attacker to generate two executable files which have the same SHA-1 hash but perform different actions when they run. Once Google releases the code behind the attack, anyone will be able to create pairs of PDF files that hash to the same SHA-1 sum, with two distinct images and certain preconditions.
                Based on such on the above information, one would be able to analyze when and where SHA-1 is OK.
                <p>
                  <strong>When/Where is SHA-1 OK?<br /></strong>
                  Checking the hash of an executable or file that we know is trusted (from trusted site)
                  No known flaws in SHA-1 as a key derivation function which is how dh-group14-sha1 is being used. 
                  Similarly, HMAC-SHA1 is believed to be (still) safe as long as SHA1 is pseudorandom. 
                  The specific construct of HMAC-SHA1 is still considered safe to use (assuming a secret key) due to the security proof for HMAC which does not rely on collision resistance of the underlying PRF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Logjam Attack research released in 2015 noted some key exchange algorithms were subject to an attack and should be disabled. In particular, they encouraged all system administrators to disable support for the diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange algorithm. But, dh-group14-sha1 is still considered safe.
